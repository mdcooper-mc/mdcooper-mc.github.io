Welcome to my portfolio of projects. This section highlights a selection of systems I've designed and delivered across
cloud-native architecture, AI orchestration, financial risk platforms and capital markets. Each project reflects a
strategic approach to modularity, resilience, and operational clarity — whether it's orchestrating BAU workflows,
extracting behavioural signals from market data, or embedding governance into model-driven pipelines.

The portfolio is built around frameworks that are difficult to replicate and easy to extend. I focus on separating
mechanical complexity from human intent, allowing systems to remain composable, cache-centric, and runtime-aware.

### Featured Projects

- **[Service Framework](/projects/service-framework/)**  
  An annotation-driven event orchestration engine for BAU workflows. It enables declarative routing, conditional
  execution, and modular service composition using Spring Boot.

- **[Reconciliation Framework](/projects/reconciliation-framework/)**  
  A provider-based framework for simplifying reconciliation logic. Engineers focus on domain-specific rules while the
  engine handles boilerplate execution, timing, and exit signalling.

- **Swaps Pricing Engine (MVP)**  
  GPU-accelerated pricing and behavioural signal extraction for structured derivatives. Designed to surface intent
  curves from market data and support real-time decisioning.

- **Cloud Cost Optimisation**  
  £2M+ annual savings achieved through Kubernetes tuning, compute right-sizing, and architectural refactoring across
  cloud workloads.

- **AI-Enabled Delivery Pipelines**  
  Embedding governance, resilience, and reproducibility into model-driven workflows for regulated environments. Supports
  auditability and runtime introspection.

- **Real-Time Payments Platform**  
  Fault-tolerant AWS orchestration for 24×7 regulatory processing. Includes observability hooks, compliance triggers,
  and retry-safe execution paths.

- **[Image Classification](/projects/image-classification/)**  
  A GPU‑accelerated, CSV‑driven framework for enriching large image and video datasets. Generates cached thumbnails, assigns CLIP‑based semantic labels, detects people and animals, and applies a hybrid AI/heuristic model to flag junk content — all in a modular, reproducible pipeline.

- **[Murex On‑Demand](/about/murex/)**  
  A containerised, CI/CD‑driven Murex platform enabling rapid, reproducible environment provisioning for development,
  testing, and training. Built on orchestration and configuration‑as‑code principles, it integrates with Datamart
  pipelines, secure messaging flows, and managed task extensions to deliver full environments in minutes instead of
  days.

Each project page includes architecture notes, runtime behaviour, and design rationale — with more to come as the
portfolio expands.
