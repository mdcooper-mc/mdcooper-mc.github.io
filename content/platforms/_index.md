Welcome to my portfolio of platforms. This section highlights a selection of systems I've designed and delivered across
cloud-native architecture, AI orchestration, financial risk platforms and capital markets. Each platform reflects a
strategic approach to modularity, resilience, and operational clarity — whether it's orchestrating BAU workflows,
extracting behavioural signals from market data, or embedding governance into model-driven pipelines.

The portfolio is built around frameworks that are difficult to replicate and easy to extend. I focus on separating
mechanical complexity from human intent, allowing systems to remain composable, cache-centric, and runtime-aware.

### Featured Platforms  


- **[Real‑Time Orchestration Platform](/platforms/real-time-orchestration/)**  
- A cloud‑native, AI‑enabled orchestration framework for high‑performance, multi‑stage workflows. Features modular service design, dynamic scaling, and cost‑reduction strategies validated in production. This platform was architected and delivered end‑to‑end, including the build and integration of all core services, versioned CI/CD pipelines, and a foundational codebase adopted across multiple teams.
