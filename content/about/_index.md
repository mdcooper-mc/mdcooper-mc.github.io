I’m Mark — a senior cloud-native developer, enterprise architect, and AI orchestration specialist with over two decades of experience designing resilient, cache-centric platforms for global financial institutions. My work spans trading systems, risk engines, and regulatory infrastructure, built for runtime clarity, composability, and strategic reuse.

I’ve delivered architecture and engineering solutions for firms including Jefferies, Citi, BlackRock, Société Générale, Rabobank, Daiwa Capital Markets, and the London Stock Exchange. My contributions range from Spring-based reconciliation frameworks and GPU-accelerated pricing engines to fault-tolerant AWS orchestration and AI-enabled delivery pipelines. I’ve worked across regulatory regimes including Basel III/IV, FRTB, MiFID II, EMIR, and Dodd-Frank — embedding governance, observability, and auditability into every layer of the stack.

My platforms are designed to support real-time trade processing, reconciliation of financial instruments, and behavioural signal extraction from market data. I’ve built systems that handle margining, capital allocation, and exposure tracking — with embedded controls for cost variance, earned value, and budget performance. Whether integrating FIX, FpML, or SWIFT flows, I focus on separating mechanical complexity from strategic insight.

I’ve also led Murex engineering programmes across Société Générale, Rabobank, and the London Stock Exchange — delivering real-time trade feeds, CI/CD-driven upgrades, and secure authentication flows. My work spans FIX, SWIFT, and FpML orchestration, Datamart and VaR enhancements, and SWIFT LAU signing — treating Murex as a strategic substrate for clarity, compliance, and runtime control.

I hold a **BSc in Computer Science** and an **MSc in Distributed Systems Engineering**, with a strong academic foundation in algorithm design, concurrency, and systems architecture. My postgraduate research included the design and deployment of a **distributed supercomputer** built from commodity hardware — engineered to support parallel computation, fault tolerance, and dynamic workload scheduling across a cluster of low-cost nodes.

Beyond systems engineering, I have a deep interest in **statistics, mathematics, and physics** — particularly in how probabilistic models, signal theory, and physical systems can inform architectural thinking. These disciplines shape how I approach behavioural signal extraction, model design, and runtime introspection in AI-enabled platforms.
