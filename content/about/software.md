I specialise in designing and delivering modular, high-performance systems across microservices architectures. With over
two decades of experience in capital markets, I‚Äôve built platforms that span trading, risk, and regulatory domains ‚Äî
engineered for resilience, observability, and strategic reuse.

My core development expertise includes **Java (8‚Äì21)**, **Spring Boot**, **Python**, **GoLang**, and **Groovy** ‚Äî
applied across microservices, event-driven systems, and secure API ecosystems. I‚Äôve led the design of scalable backend
services, containerised deployments, and orchestration frameworks that support real-time trade processing and analytics.

I‚Äôve delivered CLI tools and admission controllers in **GoLang**, built RESTful and gRPC interfaces, and optimised Helm
charts for readability and reuse. My CI/CD pipelines are built with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab CI ‚Äî supporting
multi-environment deployments, rollback safety, and automated testing. I‚Äôve implemented secure delivery patterns using
Vault, OAuth2, and pod identities, with full observability via Prometheus, Splunk, and Jaeger.

My infrastructure-as-code approach ensures reproducibility, auditability, and developer autonomy. I treat documentation
as an extension of architecture ‚Äî using Hugo and Git-based workflows to publish reproducible, modular project pages.

Whether building reconciliation engines, pricing models, or AI-enabled orchestration layers, I treat software
architecture as a strategic asset ‚Äî designed to scale, adapt, and endure.

### ‚òï Java

I‚Äôve built enterprise-grade systems using **Java 8‚Äì21**, with deep expertise in **Spring Boot**, **Spring Cloud**, and *
*Spring Security**. My Java platforms support:

- Provider-driven reconciliation engines
- Secure REST APIs with OAuth2 and JWT
- JPA-based persistence with runtime introspection
- Modular service composition using AOP, IoC, and MVC
- CI-integrated test suites with TDD and BDD patterns

These systems are designed for runtime clarity, strategic reuse, and operational transparency ‚Äî deployed across
containerised and serverless environments.

### üêç Python

I use **Python** for orchestration, analytics, and AI integration ‚Äî including:

- Flask and FastAPI services for lightweight APIs
- CLI tools and data pipelines using Poetry and virtualenv
- Integration with MLflow, Hugging Face, and OpenCV
- Feature engineering and time-series analysis for behavioural signal extraction
- Infrastructure scripting and Hugo-based documentation automation

My Python workflows are modular, reproducible, and embedded directly into CI/CD pipelines and training-as-code
platforms.

### ü¶´ GoLang

I‚Äôve delivered high-performance tools and controllers in **GoLang**, including:

- Cobra-based CLI utilities for developer tooling
- Admission controllers and policy enforcers for Kubernetes
- gRPC and Protobuf interfaces for low-latency service communication
- Secure runtime delivery with Vault, pod identity, and RBAC
- Optimised Helm charts and Skaffold workflows for reproducible deployment

GoLang is my language of choice for infrastructure tooling, runtime control, and container-native service composition.
