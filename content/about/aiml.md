This page documents my work in **AI architecture**, **deep learning**, and **reinforcement learning** ‚Äî with a focus on
**reproducibility**, **behavioural signal extraction**, and **agentic orchestration**.

I build systems that treat AI as a composable extension of infrastructure ‚Äî not just a model, but a runtime framework
for **insight**, **control**, and **strategic reuse**. My platforms span **character-level neural networks**, *
*transformer-based pipelines**, and **OpenAI Gym‚Äìdriven agents** ‚Äî engineered for **clarity**, **modularity**, and *
*embedded governance**.

### üß† Neural Engineering

I‚Äôve built foundational models from scratch using **PyTorch** ‚Äî including **manual backpropagation**, **custom layer
stacks**, and **hierarchical embedding pipelines**. These systems include:

- Context-based token prediction using **MLPs**
- **Batch normalization** and **learning rate scheduling**
- **Embedding visualization** and **loss curve tracking**
- Training loops with **manual gradient updates** and **architectural introspection**

These models are designed for **transparency** and **experimentation** ‚Äî enabling full control over **data flow**, *
*gradient propagation**, and **architectural composition**.

### üîÅ Reinforcement Learning

I‚Äôve developed agent-based systems using **OpenAI Gym** and **PIRL** ‚Äî designed to simulate **market behaviour**,
optimise **decision policies**, and extract **strategic signals** from synthetic environments. These agents include:

- **Policy-gradient optimization** with configurable **reward shaping**
- Environment design for **scenario replay** and **behavioural simulation**
- Modular training loops with **runtime introspection** and **evaluation dashboards**

My RL platforms are built for **reproducibility**, **runtime control**, and strategic alignment with **enterprise
workflows**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Orchestration & Deployment

I‚Äôve built **training-as-code platforms** that integrate with **Hugo-based documentation**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and *
*containerised environments**. These systems support:

- **Distributed training** using `torchrun` and **DDP**
- **Gradient accumulation**, **mixed precision**, and **checkpointing**
- **Autoregressive sampling** and benchmark evaluation (e.g. **HellaSwag**)
- Secure deployment with **runtime configuration** and **audit trails**

Whether training **GPT-style models** or deploying agents in **AWS**, I treat orchestration as a **first-class
architectural concern**.

### üöÄ GPU & Performance Optimisations

My training pipelines are engineered for **throughput**, **reproducibility**, and **runtime efficiency**. I‚Äôve
implemented:

- **CUDA-Aware Device Management**
- **Mixed Precision Training** with `torch.autocast` and **bfloat16**
- **Gradient Accumulation** for large effective batch sizes
- **Cosine Learning Rate Decay** with warmup scheduling
- **Checkpointing & Resume Logic** with optimizer state and RNG seeds
- **Token-Level Throughput Analysis**
- **Layer Confidence Scaling**
- **BatchNorm Buffers** for stable inference

These optimisations are embedded directly into my **training loops** and **model stacks** ‚Äî enabling scalable
experimentation and **production-grade deployment**.

- **Time-Series Forecasting**
- **Prompt-to-UI Generation**
- **Strategic Curve Modelling**
- **Scenario Replay**
- **NLP & Computer Vision**
- **Embedding Visualization**
