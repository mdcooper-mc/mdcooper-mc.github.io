## Cloud Technology

This section documents my work in cloud-native architecture, infrastructure-as-code, and serverless orchestration ‚Äî with
a focus on reproducibility, runtime clarity, and strategic reuse across AWS and Azure.

I build systems that treat cloud infrastructure as programmable, observable, and modular ‚Äî engineered for fault
tolerance, secure delivery, and operational transparency.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS & Azure Architecture

I‚Äôve designed and delivered cloud-native platforms across both AWS and Azure, including:

- **AWS**  
  EC2 | S3 | RDS | Lambda | Step Functions | API Gateway | PrivateLink | VPC | Load Balancers | IAM | CloudFormation |
  CDK | SAM CLI | EKS | SQS | SNS | Secrets Manager | Parameter Store

- **Azure**  
  AKS | ACR | VNet | Azure Functions | API Management | ARM Templates | Azure DevOps | Azure Monitor | Key Vault |
  Private Endpoints | Application Gateway | Log Analytics

These platforms support trading systems, reconciliation engines, and AI-enabled orchestration layers ‚Äî built for runtime
introspection, secure delivery, and multi-region resilience.

### üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure as Code

I use infrastructure-as-code to ensure reproducibility, auditability, and developer autonomy. My tooling includes:

- **Terraform**  
  Modular stacks with environment overlays, remote state management, and secure variable injection

- **CDK & SAM CLI**  
  Programmatic infrastructure definitions for serverless workflows, event-driven pipelines, and API orchestration

- **Helm & Kubernetes**  
  Declarative service deployment with runtime configuration, pod identity, and observability baked in

- **CI/CD Integration**  
  GitHub Actions | GitLab CI | Jenkins | TeamCity ‚Äî wired into Terraform plans, CDK synths, and Helm releases

---

### üê≥ Docker & Kubernetes

I‚Äôve built containerised microservices and orchestrated them using Kubernetes across both AWS (EKS) and Azure (AKS). My
container workflows include:

- **Docker**  
  Multi-stage builds | Layer caching | Secure image publishing | Runtime configuration via environment injection

- **Kubernetes**  
  Helm charts | Pod identity | RBAC | Network policies | Horizontal pod autoscaling | Liveness/readiness probes |
  StatefulSets | ConfigMaps | Secrets | Ingress controllers

These systems are designed for runtime observability, secure multi-tenant deployment, and modular service composition ‚Äî
with full support for GitOps, policy enforcement, and zero-downtime rollout strategies.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Build Automation & Delivery

My build pipelines support:

- Multi-environment deployments with rollback safety
- Secure artifact promotion across staging and production
- Runtime configuration via secrets managers and parameter stores
- Observability via Prometheus, Splunk, and Jaeger
- Policy enforcement via OPA, Vault, and custom admission controllers
- GitOps workflows with declarative infrastructure and automated reconciliation

Whether deploying serverless agents, containerised microservices, or AI training pipelines, I treat cloud delivery as a
strategic extension of architecture.
