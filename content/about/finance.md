I design and deliver financial systems that support the full trade lifecycle — from capture and enrichment to
reconciliation, reporting, and compliance. My platforms are built for runtime clarity, auditability, and strategic reuse
across asset classes and regulatory regimes.

I’ve engineered solutions for FX/MM, derivatives, fixed income, and structured products, integrating standards like FIX,
FpML, and SWIFT MT/MX. My work spans real-time trade processing, exposure tracking, margining, and capital allocation —
with embedded controls for cost variance, earned value, and budget performance.

On the regulatory side, I’ve built systems aligned with Basel III/IV, FRTB, MiFID II, EMIR, and Dodd-Frank. These
include risk engines, stress testing frameworks, and scenario analysis pipelines — all designed to meet evolving
compliance mandates while preserving operational agility.

I’ve also delivered reconciliation engines, compression workflows, and collateral management platforms that support
high-volume, multi-venue trading environments. My architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, provider-driven
design, and runtime introspection — enabling transparency and control across financial operations.

Whether integrating with DTCC, LCH Clearlink, Bloomberg, Refinitiv, or **Murex Trading platform**, I treat financial
infrastructure as a
strategic asset — engineered to extract insight, enforce governance, and adapt to change.

## Training Platforms

I’ve designed and integrated Murex-specific environments that mirror production workflows across trade processing,
reconciliation, and regulatory reporting. These platforms enable teams to rehearse operational scenarios, validate
system behaviour, and accelerate onboarding with precision and reproducibility.

One such environment includes CI/CD-driven refresh simulators that reduce full Murex environment rebuilds from eight
days to under fifteen minutes — using Git-based automation to streamline configuration and deployment. I’ve also built
Datamart replay engines that reconstruct historical VaR and MRA flows, allowing compliance teams to validate risk logic
under real-world conditions. For secure messaging, I developed SWIFT signing labs that simulate HMAC-secured digital
signature workflows, enabling robust testing of exchange message integrity.

Authentication sandboxes provide isolated environments for rehearsing LDAP and Kerberos integration, including
multi-factor authentication via RSA and federated identity flows. To support documentation and repeatability, I embed
modular walkthroughs directly into Hugo-based developer portals, integrating training-as-code into CI/CD pipelines for
seamless access and version control.

These systems are engineered for runtime introspection, strategic reuse, and operational clarity — ensuring that teams
train with the same rigor and transparency they deploy.
