I design and deliver financial systems that support the full trade lifecycle — from capture and enrichment to
reconciliation, reporting, and compliance. My platforms are built for runtime clarity, auditability, and strategic reuse
across asset classes and regulatory regimes.

I’ve engineered solutions for FX/MM, derivatives, fixed income, and structured products, integrating standards like FIX,
FpML, and SWIFT MT/MX. My work spans real-time trade processing, exposure tracking, margining, and capital allocation —
with embedded controls for cost variance, earned value, and budget performance.

On the regulatory side, I’ve built systems aligned with Basel III/IV, FRTB, MiFID II, EMIR, and Dodd-Frank. These
include risk engines, stress testing frameworks, and scenario analysis pipelines — all designed to meet evolving
compliance mandates while preserving operational agility.

I’ve also delivered reconciliation engines, compression workflows, and collateral management platforms that support
high-volume, multi-venue trading environments. My architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, provider-driven
design, and runtime introspection — enabling transparency and control across financial operations.

Whether integrating with DTCC, LCH Clearlink, Bloomberg, Refinitiv, or Murex, I treat financial infrastructure as a
strategic asset — engineered to extract insight, enforce governance, and adapt to change.

## Training Platforms

I’ve designed and integrated training environments that simulate real-world trading, reconciliation, and risk
workflows — enabling teams to rehearse operational scenarios, validate system behaviour, and accelerate onboarding.

These platforms include:

- **Synthetic Trade Simulation**: Generating realistic FIX and FpML flows for testing trade capture, enrichment, and
  downstream processing.
- **Regulatory Replay Engines**: Reconstructing historical market conditions to validate compliance logic under Basel,
  FRTB, and EMIR regimes.
- **Reconciliation Sandboxes**: Isolated environments for testing provider-driven reconciliation logic, exception
  handling, and audit trails.
- **Stress Testing Labs**: Configurable pipelines for scenario analysis, VaR modelling, and capital impact simulations.
- **Training-as-Code**: Modular Hugo-based documentation and walkthroughs embedded directly into CI/CD pipelines and
  developer portals.

These systems are built for reproducibility, runtime introspection, and strategic reuse — enabling teams to train with
the same rigor they deploy.
