  Reconciliation Framework


    Link to heading


The Reconciliation Engine is a modular batch-processing framework designed to execute named reconciliation routines with
precision and operational clarity. Built in Java and powered by Spring’s XML-based context configuration, the engine
allows for dynamic resolution of reconciliation logic at runtime using a provider pattern. This design enables flexible
orchestration of reconciliation workflows without requiring changes to the core application.
At its heart, the engine accepts a reconciliation name as a command-line argument and uses a
Provider&lt;String, ReconcileEngine&gt; to locate the appropriate implementation. This approach decouples the execution
logic from the entry point, allowing new reconciliation types to be added simply by registering them in the Spring
context. Additional arguments passed at runtime can be used to inject system properties, making the engine highly
configurable and environment-aware." name="description">

                <p>The Reconciliation Engine is a modular batch-processing framework designed to execute named
                    reconciliation routines with
                    precision and operational clarity. Built in Java and powered by Spring’s XML-based context
                    configuration, the engine
                    allows for dynamic resolution of reconciliation logic at runtime using a provider pattern. This
                    design enables flexible
                    orchestration of reconciliation workflows without requiring changes to the core application.</p>
                <p>At its heart, the engine accepts a reconciliation name as a command-line argument and uses a
                    <code>Provider&lt;String, ReconcileEngine&gt;</code> to locate the appropriate implementation. This
                    approach decouples the execution
                    logic from the entry point, allowing new reconciliation types to be added simply by registering them
                    in the Spring
                    context. Additional arguments passed at runtime can be used to inject system properties, making the
                    engine highly
                    configurable and environment-aware.</p>
                <p>Execution begins by parsing the input arguments and loading the Spring context from a <code>spring.xml</code>
                    configuration file.
                    Once the appropriate reconciliation engine is resolved, the framework sets any additional parameters
                    and begins
                    processing. The engine logs the start time, executes the reconciliation logic, and reports the
                    elapsed time using
                    Joda-Time’s <code>PeriodFormatter</code>. This provides clear visibility into runtime performance
                    and operational duration.</p>
                <p>The engine is designed for automation and integration into larger batch or CI/CD pipelines. It
                    returns an exit code of
                    <code>0</code> when no differences are found, and <code>-1</code> when discrepancies are detected.
                    This binary signaling allows external
                    systems to respond appropriately, whether triggering alerts, halting downstream processes, or
                    logging audit events.</p>
                <p>This project demonstrates a clean separation of concerns, runtime flexibility, and production-grade
                    logging. It’s
                    well-suited for financial systems, regulatory reporting, or any domain where reconciliation logic
                    must be modular,
                    traceable, and easy to extend.</p>
